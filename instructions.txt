1. Install Required Python Modules:
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the program files.
   - Run the following command to install the required Python modules listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. Operating System Compatibility:
   - The program supports Linux, Windows, and macOS operating systems. Ensure that the necessary firewall rules can be applied based on your operating system.

3. Run the Program:
   - After installing the required modules, you can run the program by executing the Python script.

     ```

4. Program Usage:
   - Once the program is running, it will start sniffing network traffic in real-time.
   - The program will analyze each packet and predict potential attacks using pre-trained machine learning models.
   - If an attack is detected, the program will block the source IP address using firewall rules specific to your operating system.

5. Monitoring:
   - Monitor the program's output for predictions and blocked IP addresses.
